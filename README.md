**Create. Evolve. Cast.**

---

### Overview
**VibeAR** demonstrates how AI and AR can simplify 3D creation.  
This prototype highlights the **Create → Evolve → Cast** journey,  
a no-code design process built through **Figma** and **Stitch AI**,  
and product decisions aligned with Meta’s focus on **creativity and connection**.

---

### Brand Intent
After exploring naming options like *CastAR* and *LucidDreamAR*,  
I intentionally retained the **VibeAR** identity to emphasize  
strategic continuity, handle availability, and audience recall.  
This reflects a real-world PM approach to **branding through iteration**.
